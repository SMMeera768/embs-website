   seedContent.js — safe, additive content seeder + junk cleanup

   Unlike seed.js (which calls deleteMany and wipes Users/Events/Members),
   this script never destroys real data:

     • It only inserts into collections that are already EMPTY.
     • It only deletes three specific test events, and only after
       re-checking that each one still looks like the junk record.
     • It runs as a DRY RUN unless you pass --apply.

   Usage:
     node seedContent.js              # preview, changes nothing
     node seedContent.js --apply      # actually write
     node seedContent.js --apply --seed-only
     node seedContent.js --apply --clean-only

    title: 'Why Biomedical Signal Processing Matters More Than Ever',
    excerpt: 'ECG, EEG and EMG signals carry more clinical information than most people realise. Here is why the field is having a moment.',
    content: `Every heartbeat leaves a trace. So does every muscle contraction and every burst of cortical activity. Biomedical signal processing is the discipline that turns those traces into something a clinician can act on.

For a long time the bottleneck was hardware. Recording a clean twelve-lead ECG meant a room full of equipment and a trained technician. That is no longer true. A modern analog front-end costs a few hundred rupees and fits on a board smaller than a matchbox, which means the interesting problems have shifted from acquisition to interpretation.

That shift is where students can contribute. Filtering baseline wander out of an ECG, rejecting powerline interference at 50 Hz, segmenting the QRS complex, these are well-defined problems with public datasets and decades of literature behind them. You can reproduce a published result in an afternoon and then start asking what happens when the signal is noisier than the paper assumed.

If you want a starting point, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is free, well documented, and small enough to work with on a laptop. Load a record, plot it, and try to find the R peaks by hand before you write any code. Understanding what the signal actually looks like will save you a great deal of debugging later.`,

    title: "A Student's Guide to Medical Image Segmentation",
    excerpt: 'Segmentation sounds intimidating until you realise it is mostly careful data handling plus one well-understood architecture.',
    content: `Medical image segmentation is the task of labelling every pixel in a scan. Tumour or not tumour. Vessel or background. It is the foundation of a surprising amount of clinical software, and it is one of the more approachable entry points into medical imaging research.

The architecture most people reach for is U-Net, and for good reason. It was designed for biomedical images specifically, it trains on modest datasets, and the encoder-decoder structure with skip connections is easy to reason about. You do not need a cluster of GPUs to get a sensible result on a 2D slice.

What trips students up is rarely the model. It is the data. Medical scans arrive as DICOM files with inconsistent orientations, varying slice thicknesses, and intensity ranges that differ between machines. Normalising all of that is unglamorous work, and skipping it is the fastest way to a model that scores well on your validation split and fails on anything real.

A practical tip: hold out an entire patient, not just random slices. Slices from the same scan are highly correlated, so a random split will leak information and flatter your results enormously. Split by patient and your numbers will drop. That drop is the honest number.`,

    title: 'Inside Our First Hackathon: Building a Low-Cost Pulse Oximeter',
    excerpt: 'Twenty-eight hours, nine teams, and a working SpO2 prototype built for under a thousand rupees.',
    content: `We ran our first internal hackathon in February with a deliberately narrow brief: build something that measures a real physiological parameter, and keep the bill of materials under one thousand rupees.

Nine teams entered. Six finished. The winning entry was a reflectance pulse oximeter built around a MAX30102 sensor and an ESP32, streaming SpO2 and heart rate to a phone over Bluetooth Low Energy.

The interesting part was not the hardware, which is fairly standard, but the calibration. Raw red and infrared absorbance ratios do not map to oxygen saturation without a calibration curve, and the published curves assume a specific sensor geometry. The team ended up collecting their own reference data against a commercial unit and fitting a simple quadratic. It is not clinical grade and nobody claimed it was, but the reasoning was sound and documented.

Two lessons carried over into how we run things now. First, a hard cost ceiling forces better engineering than an open budget does. Second, teams that spent the first two hours reading datasheets finished ahead of teams that spent them writing code.`,
